Idea: impliment dnd initive tracker as a discord bot
Players fill out a pdf character sheet with editable textboxes and post them to a discord channel (updating them as they lvl up)
(Character sheet pdf) -> converted to -> (statBlock)
statBlock = all the relivant information the bot need about a character.
NPC's statBlocks will be stored a database for future use.
PC statBlocks will be converted at gametime cause PC's level up and change stats.

The Dungon Master inputs commands to a discord channel to set up and run encounters.
The process for the encounter being run will follow previous implimentations.
Potential Commands:
"myOptions" return a list of all options that player has, only that player can see the message.
