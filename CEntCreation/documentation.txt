CEntCreation interface:
by Dale Westberg (Bleu)


description: The user will be able to input their character Sheet values into the interface
and submit them to be added to the local database in the Cent Table.
See sqlTables.txt for database structure.
Then the interface returns the centId of the newly formed Cent.
